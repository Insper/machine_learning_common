## Machine Learning in practice

Consider the following dataset of revenues and expenses, in thousands of Insper bucks (I$):

|   Revenue |   Expenses |
|----------:|-----------:|
|  2.62178  |    15.8963 |
|  6.655    |    20.7436 |
|  5.12396  |    17.6599 |
|  4.19061  |    17.002  |
|  1.09213  |    16.2484 |
|  1.09196  |    11.9378 |
|  0.406585 |    11.8348 |
|  6.06323  |    18.1197 |
|  4.20781  |    15.9198 |
|  4.95651  |    19.0981 |

- How much revenue we will have for an expense of I$ 10,000? How certain are you of this prediction?

- How could you write a program to automate the task of giving revenue predictions?

Now consider the dataset https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset

How would you precify a house? How to do it automatically?
